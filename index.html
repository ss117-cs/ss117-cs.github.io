        <h1>Analysis of Flights </h1>
        <p>This visualization is a narrative visualization for the user to explore the dataset of OpenFlights.
          The dataset contains separate csvs of Airport data, Airline data and Route data, and a json providing countries details for map. </p>
        <h2>Messaging</h2>
        <p>In this narrative visualization, the user can explore details on airport flights, their sources and destinations, and the flights between them.
          Thus, the messaging is that of the analysis of airline data, with annotations and instructions in each scene.</p>
        <h2>Narrative Structure</h2>
        <p>The narrative structure is that of an interactive slideshow. The scenes allow the ordering of a user-directed path in all three scenes. The user can go to previous and the next bookmarks, as well as drill down and drill up in all the three scenes. So, this is a hybrid structure of interactive visualization, with each scene providing the user the opportunity to form focused queries with a focus on the message.</p>
        <h2>Visual Structure</h2>
        <p>In the flight bar chart, the user can navigate the scene by clicking on any of the bars for the airlines to drill down to look at the concentration of flights associated with that airline</p>
        <p>In the bubble chart, the user can navigate the scene by clicking on the bubble chart to drill down the map into the different countries associated with the airports.</p>
        <p>In the sunburst chart, the user can navigate the scene by clicking on the different pies, and keep exploring the information associated with the different levels of hierarchy in the pie.</p>
        <h2>Scene</h2>
        <p>In the flight bar chart , the user is looking at flights grouped by airlines first so as to get an idea of the distribution of the flights associated with each major airline, and then transition to the scene of the bubble chart which provides an overview of the busiest countries and cities being serviced these major airlines.The user can then transition to the sunburst chart, which provides the ability for the user to drill down to the details of each country by drilling down the hierarchy levels, and see which are the common destinations for different cities.</p>
        <h2>Annotation</h2>
        <p>The annotations follow the same template of a text box with red background and information within the scene.This template is chosen to draw attention to the associated message within the annotation and that is how they support the messaging too.The annotations remain the same on the scene as the user build up to a conclusion.</p>
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p>In the flight bar chart , the parameters are the different bars showing the different airlines. The states are that of the different number of associated flights. We also show the entire flight map and the bars of the associated airlines all at once. The parameters of the bars are used to define the value of the state of the associated number of flights in the scene. In the bubble chart, the parameters are the different bubbles showing the different cities, as well as the groupings of the country. The states are-the number of flights associated with each country, and all the flights. We also show the entire state at once. The parameters of the bubbles are used to define the value of the state of the associated number of flights associated with the city in the state. The parameters of the grouping by country shows the bubbles associated with the country, and are useful in state a.In the sunburst chart, the parameters are the different pies showing the different values of the hierarchy. The states are the different levels of hierarchy. We animate each state with a delay once the parameter is clicked. Within each state, the parameters provide you an indication of how to drill down the get the useful information from the associated children.</p>
        <h2>Triggers</h2>
        <p>In the flight bar chart , the trigger is clicking on the different bars showing the different airlines.In the bubble chart, the trigger is clicking on the toolbar at the top, showing the two options of the different states. In the sunburst chart, the trigger is clicking on the different pies, showing the options of the different hierarchies.</p>

        <h1>Flights by Airlines and Flight Map</h1>
        <p>​​We are looking at the data by Airlines for the top 32 airlines.</p>
        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>With 3 separate raw data csvs, the dataset was cleaned using Openrefine and merged into one single csv and filtered for the top 32 airlines. </p>
        <h2>How to use</h2>
        <p>The user can click on any of the bars and it will show the associated flights in the map.</p>

        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>The top 32 airlines csv is converted into another csv with grouping by city and country for the bubble chart. The top 7 countreis were maintained and the others were merged into the value of 'Others'. </p>
        <h2>How to use</h2>
  			<p>The user can toggle display between All Countries, and By Country. The toggle triggers the change of bubble’s co-ordinates
          into their respective groupings.</p>

        <p>​​We can deep dive into the data for each country here, looking at source city, source airport, destination country, destination city and airlines at each level.</p>
        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>​The data was cleaned again for the sunburst diagram, with a lot of entries merged into the value of 'Others', so as to keep the sunburst diagram clean. </p>
        <h2>How to use</h2>
        <p>In the Sunburst Visualization, a user can click on a region, which zooms into the data into the underlying information. Clicking the centre circle will return the values for one level up in the hierarchy.
          Clicking anywhere else in the chart will bring the user back to the topmost level.</p>
